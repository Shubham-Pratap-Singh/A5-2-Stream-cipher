## What is A5/2 Stream Cipher?
Wikipedia provides us with an amazing explanation.
A5/2 is a stream cipher used to provide voice privacy in the GSM cellular telephone protocol. It was used for export instead of the relatively stronger (but still weak) A5/1. It is one of seven A5 ciphering algorithms that have been defined for GSM use.
